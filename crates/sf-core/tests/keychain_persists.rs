//! Checks that a stored secret survives the process that wrote it.
//!
//! `keyring` without a platform feature compiles and passes a store-then-read
//! test inside one process, because it falls back to a store held in process
//! memory. Nothing persists and no error is raised, so a same-process test is
//! blind to exactly the defect this guards against.
//!
//! StateForge ships for macOS, Windows and Linux, and each has its own backend,
//! so the check runs on all three. It distinguishes three outcomes:
//!
//! - writing fails: a real backend is compiled in but its service is missing,
//!   which is the normal state of a Linux CI runner with no D-Bus secret
//!   service. Not the defect, so the test passes and says so.
//! - writing succeeds and a second process reads the value back: a real,
//!   persistent store.
//! - writing succeeds and the second process finds nothing: the in-memory
//!   fallback, which is the defect.
//!
//! The second process is this same binary re-run, not `/usr/bin/security`. The
//! keychain grants read access per application, so a different binary asking
//! for an item it did not create raises an authorisation dialog that blocks CI
//! and interrupts whoever is at the keyboard.
